[![Custom badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper-Arxiv-b31b1b?logo=arxiv&logoColor=white?style=flat-square)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14239)

The KoMA framework consisting of the multi-agent interaction, the multi-step planning,
the shared-memory, and the ranking-based reflection modules to enhance multi-agentsâ€™ decision-making in complex driving scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Requirements
we recommend using conda to create an python virtual environment.

Note that if you want to use the Memory module, you need to run the code under linux
```python
conda create -n KoMA python=3.8
conda activate KoMA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration
All configurable parameters are located in `config.yaml`.

Before running KoMA, set up your OpenAI API keys in `config.yaml`.

### Using local LLMs
If you want to locally deploy some free open-source large language models via Ollama for testing, please download and deploy them according to the webpage `https://ollama.com/`. Note that you need to modify the `API_TYPE` in the `config.yaml` file and change the type of the large language model in `LLMDriver/driverAgent` (default is `llama3`).

### Running KoMA
```python
python main.py
```

## Usage

### Switching simulation scene
All simulation scenarios are set in `highway_env/envs`. 

The total number of vehicles in the initial simulation scenario does not exceed 8. We have only set up 8 random spawn locations for vehicles
You can customize the simulation scenario to solve this problem.

### one-lane
The configuration key 'KoMA-merge-generalization' should be replaced with 'KoMA-merge-onelane' in `main.py`.
```python
config={
    'KoMA-merge-onelane':
}
```

### three-lane
```python
config={
    'KoMA-merge-threelane':
}
```

### roundabout
```python
config={
    'KoMA-merge-roundabout':
}
```
